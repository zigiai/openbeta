# **How we cut our Pull Request cycle from 5.8 days to 1 day**

We’re a team of developers who have led large development teams (separately and together) for over a decade. As hard as we tried to improve productivity in our teams, nothing seemed to work. If anything, it just seemed to be getting worse. So we did what everyone else appeared to be doing - we added **more** systems, more dashboards, more processes. **_Didn’t work_**. 

We decided to rethink how we approach the dev process, and we started with a process that we do several times a day -** the Pull Request process**. As developers, you probably know exactly what I mean - there’s a ridiculous amount of friction and noise in the PR process. 

### **Managing the Pull Request cycle**

We decided to build a system that uses the data supplied by third-party systems, filters the information, and only shows me what I actually need for my work, in Slack. The aim was to create seamless communication around our work. 

The system, called [Zigi](https://www.zigi.ai/), works like this:

Once a PR is created in GitHub, Zigi manages the entire workflow:



* Gathers all the communications related to a PR
* Tells me which PRs are waiting for my review, from all repos
* Shows which of my PRs are waiting for a teammates’ review, and for how long
* Makes it easy to ping teammates to remind them (without feeling awkward about bothering them)
* Lets me add reviewers (+ coming soon - ability to choose reviewers by availability) 
* Tells me when a PR is stuck or open for a long time
* Helps me make sure the code owner approved

Being able to manage the entire PR process from Slack has helped us reduce our own PR cycle time by over 50% - **from almost 6 days to 1.**

We opened Zigi to the dev community (open Beta) and we’ve been working closely with several dev teams to test our theory. We then compared the numbers - two months working with Zigi vs. two months without. 

Here’s the improvement experienced by developers using Zigi to automate their PR cycles:

We were able to cut PR cycle time by _days_. 

### **Additional processes: Jira and Git integration from Slack**

We added several additional capabilities to Zigi, including the ability to identify and sync activities in Jira and Git:



* Identify PRs in Github that aren’t connected to a Jira ticket
* Update Jira ticket statuses directly from slack
* Let you know when there are new comments or activities related to your tasks

To sum up, our mission is to add more and more tools to Zigi that will help each developer manage their personal workflow, in the most efficient way possible, giving them only the information they need, when they need it, from one place - Slack. 

We really believe that removing the background noise and overhead around mundane, non-coding tasks is the only way forward for dev teams. 

### **Where we stand now**

Zigi is currently in open Beta - you can sign up via the site and within 1 working day, you’ll receive a link to set up.

A few more important things:



* Zigi is free. In the future, we’ll start introducing paid features for power users and teams, but the current features and capabilities will always be free. 
* Zigi only needs user-level permissions and doesn’t read or scan your code
* Zigi has been built for maximum security and privacy, adhering to the highest security standards in the market. 
* Zigi is ISO 27001/27017 & Soc 2 Type 2 certified, and GDPR compliant

Zigi is most suitable for large dev teams working in different locations that need help managing their day-to-day processes. But any team with more than 10 developers will already feel the benefits.

We currently support Slack, Jira, Github, Calendar, and we’ll be adding more tools soon. 

You’re also welcome to join our open [support group in Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/zigisupport/shared_invite/zt-1b81pibd3-HPo7hJZs9Ji6IwIJz2yo_A), give feedback, and help us build something that we all love.
